Some E-textile materials and assembling technics have been experimented during the Schmiede festival 2014 in Hallein (Austria), with Hannah and Mika from kobakant: http://www.kobakant.at who organised the Electronic Textiles Live Workshops.

This matrix is made out of rows and columns conductive fabric fused onto a basic cotton fabric.
In between the e-textile matrix a 20K Eeonyx piezoresistive fabric allow pressure detection.
The rows and columns are connected to a Teensy microcontroller to scan and measure all pressures positions on the fabric surface.
All values are send to an application that show a real time 3D fabric model who produce OSC messages that can be used in audio application such PureData, SuperCollider, etc.
