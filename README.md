## About The project

###Transforming the textile into an intuitive way to interact with computers. This project is part of electronic textiles research on IHM gesture interaction that have been started in 2005.

From the beginning this project motivate the development of technologies in artistic use cases : playing music, combine graphics end sound, imagine objects that can have tactile properties, etc. Using a fabric to sense the touch is now possible with this eTextile matrix sensor that includes conductive fibers and a layer of piezoresistive textile. Some new E-textile materials and assembling techniques were experimented during the 2014 batch of the Schmiede residency in Hallein (Austria), with Hannah and Mika from kobakant who organised the Electronic Textiles Live Workshops. Made of conductive textile shaped in rows and columns fused onto a basic cotton fabric, this matrix is designed to be easy to make. To add the presure proerty a 20Kohm Eeonyx piezoresistive fabric is added in between the e-textile matrix. For the electronic components we still work on a new version that will integrate a dedicated microcontroller. On the software side we can visualise a representation of the eTextile matrix sensor that show the pressures points and their positions on the virtual fabric surface. This 3D real time model analyse the touch to trigger OSC messages that can be used in audio application such as PureData, SuperCollider, etc.
