Some E-textile materials and assembling techniques were experimented during the 2014 batch of the Schmiede residency in Hallein (Austria), with Hannah and Mika from kobakant: http://www.kobakant.at who organised the Electronic Textiles Live Workshops.

This matrix is made of conductive textile shaped in rows and columns fused onto a basic cotton fabric.
In between the e-textile matrix, a 20Kohm Eeonyx piezoresistive fabric allows pressure sensing.
The rows and columns are connected to a Teensy microcontroller to measure pressures points and their positions on the fabric surface.
All values are sent to an application that shows a real time 3D model that produce OSC messages that can be used in audio application such as PureData, SuperCollider, etc.
