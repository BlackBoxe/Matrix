All values are sent to an application that shows a real time 3D model that produce OSC messages that can be used in audio application such as PureData, SuperCollider, etc.\r\n\r\nProject content\r\n===============\r\n - the Arduino firmware (source files)\r\n - the Eagle PCP (source files)\r\n - the openframeworks software (source files)\r\n\r\nDocs\r\n====\r\n - http://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=4305/\r\n - https://www.flickr.com/photos/maurin/15378383106/\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n====\r\n - ...\r\n",
