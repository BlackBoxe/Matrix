Using various weights on various diameter discs to have a same force/surface:

disc0:  1.25cm  31.2g   (4  coins)
disc1:  2.5cm   124.8g  (16 coins)
disc2:  5cm     500g    (64 coins)
disc3:  7.5cm   1kg

3 steps horizontally (cm): 18, 19, 20
7 steps vertically (cm):   10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12, 12.5, 13

The reference is orthonormal.
The discs coordinates are taken at their bottom right tangents.
