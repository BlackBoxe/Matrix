Using various weights on various diameter discs to have a same force/surface:

    disc0:  1.25cm  31.2g   (4  coins) => 1.227cm² => 25.26g/cm²
    disc0a: 2cm     78.0g   (10 coins) => 3.142cm² => 25.83g/cm²
    disc1:  2.5cm   124.8g  (16 coins) => 4.908cm² => 25.42g/cm²
    disc1a: 3cm     179.4g  (23 coins) => 7.068cm² => 25.38g/cm²
    disc2:  5cm     500g    (64 coins) => 19.63cm² => 25.47g/cm²
    disc3:  7.5cm   1kg                => 44.17cm² => 22.63g/cm²

Measure details:
  - 3 steps horizontally (cm): 18, 19, 20
  - 7 steps vertically (cm): 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12, 12.5, 13
  - each (0.5 eu) coin weights 7.8g

The reference is orthonormal. The discs coordinates are taken at their bottom right tangents.
